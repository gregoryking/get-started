== Introduction

This guide will teach you how to import data from flat files and how to map the data to your graph data model.

If you havent't already, please go through the _Getting started with Neo4j_ to learn the basics of Neo4j, including a brief introduction to the _graph property model_ and how this relates to the relational database model.

// TODO: Add a link to the getting started guide if possible

The _Getting started with Neo4j_ guide shows you the basics on the topic of importing data, but this guide will go more in-depth and focus solely on Data Importer.

The topics covered in this guide are:

* Scope of Importer
* Provision of files
* Your model
* Preview your import
* Run your import
* Exploring the resulting graph
* Saving and loading
* Re-running the import
* What's next?
* FAQ

You will be working with the Northwind dataset about a fictional company, it may be familiar if you have taken other Workspace guides.


== What is Data Importer for?

Data Importer is designed to get you modeling and importing with Neo4j as quickly as possible.
It's recommended if you're new to graphs or have rapid prototyping needs.

However, there are other ways to load data into Neo4j, especially when you have more advanced needs.
At the end of this guide the _What's next?_ step gives links to resources on the many different ways of loading data into Neo4j.

But now let's focus on how to get the most out of Data Importer.
The following sections will explain the three-stage process of:

. Providing your **flat files**
. Defining a **graph model**
. **Mapping** the flat files to the graph model

Click on to start learning!

== The three stages of data import

=== Flat files

The leftmost panel is the highlight:import/import-file-panel[Files] panel.
As you add files, they will be listed here, along with the headers read from the file and an example value.

You can add new files by clicking the highlight:import/import-file-panel-browse-button[Add files] button at the top right of the pane.
This will open a file dialog from which you can select files from your computer.
You can also drag and drop CSV or TSV files directly into the pane.

As you map column headers to your graph model, a green indicator will appear to the left of the column name.


=== Graph model

The highlight:import/import-model-panel[Graph model] panel in the centre of the screen is used to define your graph model.

To add a node, click the highlight:import/import-add-node[Add node] button.
To create relationships, position your cursor at the edge of the node until a grey ring appears.
Drag the course to an existing node to create a relationship, or release the cursor in an empty canvas area to create a relationship to a new node.
"Self relationships" where a node links to itself can be created in a similar way.

image::import-create-relationships.gif[]

Nodes are deleted from the data model using the icon:TrashIcon[] highlight:import/import-delete-node-or-rel[button].

=== Mapping

The highlight:import/import-mapping-panel[Mapping details] panel define the metadata for the nodes and relationships, such as their properties, in your graph model.
This is also where you define the mapping of the columns from the flat files to parts of your graph model.

The mapping stage is all about helping Data Importer understand how files are used to create nodes and relationships.
In other words, giving it all the infomration it needs to run an import job.

//Click on a node or relationship in the graph model to see its corresponding mapping details.

Now that you are familiar with the UI, click **Next** to try a real example.

== Add the Northwind files

To get started, {northwind-subset-data-only-zip-file}[download and unzip the zip archive^] and drop them CSV files onto the the highlight:import/import-file-panel[Files] panel.

[%collapsible]
.Are you having trouble?
====
You can also click the following button to add the CSV files directly into Workspace.

button::Add Northwind files[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={northwind-subset-data-only-zip-file}]
====

=== File structure

Now that you've added the files you should be able to see each file's header and first row of data in the highlight:import/import-file-panel[Files panel].

[TIP]
====
Data Importer always requires files to have a *header row* as well as at least one *data row* in order to perform mapping and import data.
====


The `order-details.csv` file looks like this:

----
OrderID,ProductID,UnitPrice,Quantity,Discount
10248,11,14.00,12,0
10248,42,9.8,10,0
10248,72,34.8,5,0
----

This specific file tells us which orders contain which products and at what price.
If you look closer at the content of the file, you'll notice that `OrderID` is repeated and we'll learn later on how this can be used to create a `CONTAINS` relationship linking `Orders` and `Products`.

The other two files, `products.csv` and `orders.csv`, tell us about the specific `Orders`` and `Products`, along with thier attributes and unique identifiers.

Let's have a look at the model next.


== Thinking about your model

You are likely familiar with the the concept of a _graph data model_ from the Getting started guide, but if not, here's a recap how to create a basic graph model.
The graph data model you create is a **funadmental** part of your graph database setup.
It determines both the ease with which you can write queries and how peformant they will be.
After compelting this guide you may want to explore our https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/modeling-fundamentals/[Graph Data Modelling Fundamentals^] course on Graph Academy.

As observed already, the data concerns `Orders` that `CONTAIN` specific `Products`.
Conventionally, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case[CamelCase^] is used for node labels and upper-case https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case[SNAKE_CASE^] is used for relationship types.

You are going to start by creating a simple model with two nodes and one relationship.

image::simple-model.png[]

In the next step, you'll create this model and map data to it as you go.

== Create and map nodes

=== Create the node

Add a node using the highlight:import/import-add-node[Add node] button, and give it the label `Order`.
You can either enter the label for the node directly into the node on the graph model or in highlight:import/import-node-label[Label] section of the highlight:import/import-mapping-panel[Mapping details] panel.
Note that a label is mandatory for nodes.

=== Choose file to map

The node you have just created has a dashed outline, this indicates it isn't fully mapped yet.
To fix this, you need to start by selecting which file it should map to.
Select `orders.csv` from the highlight:import/import-node-file-dropdown[File dropdown] in the highlight:import/import-mapping-panel[Mapping details panel].


=== Add properties

You have two different options to add properties to your node:

. Using the highlight:import/import-select-from-file-button[Select from file] button.
// This allows you to select columns from the mapped file and automatically create a property of the same name mapped to the file column.
// It will also guess the property datatype for you based on a sample of values in the mapped file column.
. Alternatively, you can specify the properites and their data types in isolation of the mapping using the highlight:import/import-property-add-button[Add property] button.
You can then map file column to the property in the File mapping tab.
// TODO: Add highlight id to allow mapping tab to be highlighted.

You're going to use the first option, so go ahead and click highlight:import/import-select-from-file-button[Select from file].

Select the `orderID`, `orderDate` and `requiredDate` columns and *Confirm*.
You will see this adds three properties to the node.
Make sure to check the property names and change them if they've been predicted incorrectly.
// TO-DO: Change the date strings to ones that are better auto detected by data importer(!) Maybe have one that is guessed and one that isn't?


In this example, shorthen the `orderID` property to simply read `ID`.
Click the *pencil icon* against the `orderID` property, change the property name to `ID` and confirm the change by pressing the *check mark*.
If you inspect the `File mapping` tab, you'll see this `ID` property is still mapped to the `orderID` column.

// TODO: Can we get these icons workign and inserted at appropriate place in above paragraph
// icon:PencilIconOutline[]
// icon:CheckIconOutline[]

=== Select an ID

Returning to the _Definition_ tab, the last thing to do is to select a property as node highlight:import/import-node-id[ID].
The purpose of selecting an ID for a node is two-fold:

. If the node is referenced more than once in the file, the ID ensures that the node is not created more than once.
. The node ID is used when connecting nodes with relationships, as you'll learn shortly.

It's self-explanatory here that the `ID` property should be the ID for the node.
In this example, Data Importer has selected it for you automatically (based on the property name containing the `ID` string), but in other cases you may need to select the `ID` manually or correct an `ID` Data Importer picks for you.

Now repeat the process to create a `Product` node from the `products.csv` file.
Here you need to map the `productID` and `productName` columns, rename the `productID` property to be simply `ID` in a similar way we did for the `Order` node and ensure `ID` is selected as the ID.

[%collapsible]
.Are you having trouble?
====

If you're unsure if you've followed the steps correctly so far, you can go ahead and load the correct mapping so everything is in order before continuing.

button::Load Northwind node mapping[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={northwind-subset-node-only-mapping-zip-file}]
====


== Create relationships

You have two nodes and now you need to create a relationship to connect them.
Hover by the edge of the `Order` node circle and you'll see a `+` sign.
Click and drag it and you'll see another circle.
Drag the new circle on to the `Product` node and release to create the relationship.

Give your relationship a type, which is a descriptive name for the relationship.
As with nodes, you can do this directly in the graph model or in the highlight:import/import-relationship-type[Type] section of the highlight:import/import-mapping-panel[Mapping details panel].

In the model you are creating, an order _contains_ a product, so go ahead and give it a type of `CONTAINS`.

Just like newly created nodes, the relationship is dashed until you add mapping details.

=== Map a file

The next stage is critical in helping Data Importer understand how a file defines a relationship.
This is what will give you a connected graph.

If you look in the highlight:import/import-file-panel[Files] panel, you'll see `order-details.csv` has columns that correspond with the `ID` of your `Order` and `Product` nodes.
Ensuring you have the relationship selected, select the `order-details.csv` file from the highlight:import/import-relationship-file-dropdown[File dropdown].
// TODO: Add id selector for relationship dropdown to enable UI higlighting

In the highlight:import/import-relationship-mapping-table[relationship mapping table] you will see the Nodes and ID properties at each end of the `CONTAINS` relationship.

The *From*-end of the node is the `Order` node with the `ID` property (remember that this property was mapped to the `orderId` column in the `orders.csv` file).
Your `order-details.csv` file also contains an `orderID` column, so select this in the highlight:import/import-rel-from-dropdown[From] dropdown.
This gives Data Importer the information it requires to link up the *From*-end of the relationship.

Similarly, you need to select the correct file column for the *To*-end of the relationship which is `productId` in the highlight:import/import-rel-to-dropdown[To] dropdown.

There should now be no dashed outlines in the highlight:import/import-model-panel[Graph Model pane] as you have successfully mapped the file.

=== Adding properties

For relationships, you can also optionally add properties if they are useful.

In the `order-details.csv` file you can see the columns `unitPrice`, `quantity` and `discount`.
These could be useful to add as properties to the `CONTAINS` relationship.
These properties couldn't easily be encapsulated on the nodes at either end of the relationship.
For example `quantity` does not belong on either the `Product` or `Order` nodes since products are sold in different quantities on different orders.
Just as you did for nodes, use the highlight:import/import-select-from-file-button[Select from file] button to map those columns to new properties on the relationship.

You don't need to include the `orderID` or the `productID` here, as their only purpose is to create the `CONTAINS` relationship in your model and you've already used them to do that.

[%collapsible]
.Are you having trouble?
====

If you're unsure if you've followed the steps correctly so far, you can go ahead and load the correct mapping so everything is in order before continuing.

button::Load model and mapping[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={northwind-subset-node-and-relationship-mapping-zip-file}]
====

== Dealing with different file structures

=== Relationship defined in the same file as one node

In this example, a separate link file `order-details.csv` defines the relationship linking `Orders` and `Products`.

However, it is quite common to have files where the relationship is defined by the same file as that used for the node at one (or sometimes both) ends of the relationship.
In the example, you can see how the `orders.csv` file also contains a `shipVia` column which could be used to define the relationship to a `Shipper` node created from the `shippers.csv` file.

To see what this mapping looks like, load the example configuration and inspect it.

button::Load Northwind shipper mapping[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={northwind-subset-shipper-mapping-zip-file}]

You can see that the `orders.csv` file is used to define both the `Order` node and the `SHIPS` relationship, as well as mapping the `Shipper` node to `shippers.csv`.

=== Relationship defined in the same file as both nodes

In examples where the nodes at each end of the relationship are both mapped to the same file, the relationship can ususally be inferred by the same file. If you first set up the nodes with their IDs and mapping, when you draw the relationship, Data Importer will assist you by mapping the *From* and *To* parts of the relationship automatically.

You can try this out by loading the simple example below and connecting the two nodes that are mapped to the same file:

button::Load people and locations[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={people_locations_nodes_only_zip_file}]

This is the model you are aiming for:

image::import-people and locations.png[]

If you add the relationships as above, you'll observe that the *From* and *To* relationships are automatically mapped for you.

// TO-DO: Is not so neat in this example switching to a completely different context - would be better to add a northwind related example of ths - look at doing this as it's a good example to show.

[%collapsible]
.Are you having trouble?
====
You can also click the button to load the people and locations with their relationship mapping.

button::Load configuration[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={people_locations_full_zip_file}]
====

== Ready to import?

Let's get back to the Nortwind Model and pick up where you left off.
Start by reloading the small Northwind model you created.

button::Load model and mapping[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={northwind-subset-node-and-relationship-mapping-zip-file}]

Any dashed lines in your model means that the mapping is not complete.
If the mapping is not complete, you will not be able to run the import.

The following items **must be** mapped on a **node**:

* Label
* File
* A minimum of one property
* ID

The following items **must be** mapped on a **relationship**:

* Type
* File
* ID file columns (for both *From* and *To* nodes)

If you have done all your mapping and are satisfied with your model, you can _preview_ your graph before running the import.

== Preview your graph

When you're satisfied with your model and mapping, you can preview a sample of your data before running the actual import.

Click the highlight:import/import-load-preview-button[Preview] button to see a sample of your data visualized.

image::preview.png[]

Even though the preview only scans the first few rows of your files, it is often sufficient to make sure everything connects as expected.
But you should keep in mind that it is only a preview and only a sample of your data.
The actual graph may look different once the full import is complete.

You want to have your mapping completely done before previewing, but if you have missed something, you are still able to do a preview, but the incomplete elements will not be rendered.
In other words, any dashed element in your model will not show up in the preview.

As mentioned before, if any element in your model is dashed, you will **not** be able to run the import.

== Running an import

You have drawn your data model, mapped every single element, and checked the preview to make sure things connect the way you intended.
This means you are ready to run the actual import.

Click highlight:import/import-run-import-button[Run import] to import the files specified in your model.
The simple model you have created in this example only maps to three of the eleven available files.
The files not specified in your model are *not* imported, but they remain in the highlight:import/import-file-panel[Files panel].

If any mapping is incomplete, Data Importer will tell you that your model has errors and add a red exclamation mark next to the incomplete element in the model.
When you select an incomplete element, the mapping pane also highlights the missing details.

Once you've addressed the errors, go ahead and run the import again.
You should see a popup window showing the successful results.

image::import_results.png[]

The _Import results_ summarizes what was included in the import.
You can compare to your CSV files to verify that everything was imported.

[NOTE]
====
If you run this guide after the _Getting Started_, the count may show _updated_ rather than _created_ since Data Importer will ensure duplicate IDs are not created for elements already loaded.
====

== Cypher statements

You can also see the Cypher commands used to create the elements in your model.
This can be helpful if you want to gain appreciation for the underlying Cypher required to execute the load.
Let's have a look at _Order_ nodes.
Click _Show Cypher_ on _Order_ which reveals the key statement:

.Key statement
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT `imp_uniq_Order_orderID` IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (n: `Order`)
REQUIRE (n.`orderID`) IS UNIQUE;
----

This ensures that the `orderID` is unique which is important since this is what is used later to create the relationship between the _Order_ nodes and the _Product_ nodes.
As you will see later on, this constraint is also what allows you to run the import more than once.

The load statement creates all the _Order_ nodes sets all their properties.
Both key and load statements look similar to this for the _Product_ nodes.

But let's have a look at the Cypher statement to create the relationships:

.Load statement
[source,cypher]
----
UNWIND $relRecords AS relRecord
MATCH (source: `Order` { `orderID`: toInteger(trim(relRecord.`orderID`)) })
MATCH (target: `Product` { `productID`: toInteger(trim(relRecord.`productID`)) })
MERGE (source)-[r: `CONTAINS`]->(target);
SET r.`unitPrice` = toFloat(trim(relRecord.`unitPrice`))
SET r.`quantity` = toInteger(trim(relRecord.`quantity`))
SET r.`discount` = toFloat(trim(relRecord.`discount`));
----

From this you can see how the source node and the target node are `MATCH` ed (found in the data) and then a `MERGE` statement is used to create a `CONTAINS` relationship _from_ the source node _to_ the target node.
You can also see the the properties added to each relationship.

== Explore the graph

With the data imported it's time to explore.
Go ahead and navigate to the _Explore_ tab or click the button below:

button::Explore[role=NX_TAB_NAV,tab=explore]

The _Explore_ tab allows you to visualize and interact with your data with minimal use of Cypher.
To start out, let's have a quick look at a sample of your data.

You can see that the search bar in the top left corner is already populated with _Show me a graph_.
Click the bar and press enter.
As well as showing the sample graph, you can use the search bar to find and display any of the elements in your data.
You can use near-natural language for this and that means that Explore understands a vocabulary based on the categories, labels, relationship types, property keys and property values of your dataset.

The legend panel on your right gives you an overview of the elements in your graph with one tab for nodes and one for relationships.
You can filter to show only the elements visible in the current scene or the ones not currently visible.
If you select an element from the legend panel, you can change the styling of all the nodes/relationships with that label/type **or** apply rule-based styling based on properties.

For a more comprehensive guidance on the Explore tab, see the https://www.neo4j.com/docs/bloom-user-guide/current[Neo4j Bloom User Guide].

== Saving and loading

Now switch back to the Import tab.

button::Import[role=NX_TAB_NAV,tab=import]

You have created a simple model and mapped data to it.
Often, the datamodel is a bit more complicated than this example model.
Regardless of complexity, you may want to come back to your model at some point.
Data Importer lets you _download_ your model, with or without the data you've mapped to it.

image::save-load.png[]

When you choose to download your model, with or without data, you are essentially saving it.
The model doesn't have to be mapped for you to download.

If you have a downloaded model, you can open it from this same menu, again with or without data.

The data is stored as CSV-files and the model as a json-file, which makes it easy to share.

== Run an import again

You can run the import multiple times without duplicating your data.
For example, if you want to make some changes to your model after you've run the import, just fix your model and when you are happy run the import again.
The changes you made will overwrite what you had before, but no existing elements will be recreated.

This is due to the uniqueness constraints in the import.
Recall the Cypher statements from the Import summary.
In case of re-running the import, this constraint ensures that if an element, with an ID, already exists, it will not be created again.

To demonstrate this, try the button below to download the entire Northwind dataset and run the import.

button::Load the full Northwind dataset[role=NX_IMPORT_LOAD,endpoint={northwind-data-importer-model-data-zip-file}]

This action will not lead to any duplication of the `Order` and `Product` nodes nor of the relationships.
To verify further, the new model calls the relationship type between `Order` and `Product` `ORDERS` instead of `CONTAINS`.
Click the button to go to the _Explore_ tab.

button::Explore[role=NX_TAB_NAV,tab=explore]

In the search bar, type _Order_ and _Product_ and press enter.
In the graph displayed in the Scene, click on any relationship and you can see it offers the `ORDERS` option as well as `CONTAINS`.
The `Order` and `Product` nodes have been retained and not recreated because their data importer configuration was identical, but since we added a new relationship type of `ORDERS`, this was added to the load.
The `CONTAINS` relationship is still retained from the previous import run. The old relationships would need to be removed with Cypher, or the load run on a clean database to only keep the relationships in the latest iteration of the model and mapping.

// TODO: I think there is a Bloom bug to be resolved. When I run a second load that adds new relationships, Bloom doesn't update and the perspectice has to be manually refreshed to take into account the newly added node labels and rel types.

== When you outgrow the Data Importer

Data Importer, as a UI tool, is not best placed to meet _all_ of your varied load needs, whether they are transformations or differing data formats.
If you can't achieve a load in Data Importer, the chances are you can achieve the load using some of the other approaches to loading data into Neo4j.
The following are useful resources for different needs:

- https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/load-csv/[LOAD CSV]] for writing your own bespoke Cypher load scripts from CSVs, leveraging the full capabilities of Cypher.
- https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tutorial/neo4j-admin-import/[Neo4j-admin import]] for loading large amounts of CSV data rapidly into an offline database
- https://neo4j.com/product/connectors/[Neo4j connectors] to connect data from a variety of soruces into Neo4j.
- https://neo4j.com/docs/apoc/current/overview/apoc.load/[APOC Load procedures] for specialist Cypher procedures to make it easier to ingest data from formats including, json, xml and arrow.

== Frequently Asked Questions

*Missing files - Why does data importer say I need to provide my files after I've aready provided them?*

*Why does it happen so often?*

When you provide Data Importer with your files, you are actually providing your Web Browser with a link to those files on your local filesystem, they aren't uploaded anywhere - Data Importer streams the content of the files to you database only when you run the import.
If you reload the page, Data Importer loses access to the connection to those files due to security restrictions.
These are in place to prevent web applications accessing files you haven't given express permission to use on page load.
You simply need to re-provide the files when requested by data importer to be able to run an import.

*How can I replace a file?*

Data Importer doesn't currently allow you to swap out files in the UI.
However, there is a workaround that may prove useful.
If you want to provide a different file with the same column structure to data importer, you can rename it to match and then simply add the file to the files panel.
This will replace the reference to the latest file and be available for use by your import.


*How do I change the database data importer loads into?*

If you are using a Neo4j instance that supports multiple databases, Data Importer will use the home database to import data into.
You may have the facility to change the home database for the user that you connect to your DBMS with, read more on setting the home database for a user https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/access-control/manage-users/[here].
